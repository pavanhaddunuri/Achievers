[(a) = [(b) * [(2) + (foo(((c) * (3))))]]];

LEFT to RIGHT -- > Operator evaluation

JS language is a scripting language and its not interpretive.

JS is a compiled language.

Ways to output :

alert --> Basically given by browser
Console.log() --> By JS

Ways to input :

Prompt() 

Values and Types:
No diff between single quotes and double quotes in JS.
console.log() --> Prints out what ever it has.
alert() --> changes it to a string

IN JS --> Conversion is called as Coercion.

Coercion :
	-- Explicit
	-- Implicit

a = String(a) ==> Converts to string
b = Number(b) ==> Converts to number.

In JS the value has a type and the variable does not have a type. 

What is the subtle difference b/w values and variables in JS and other static languages like C#?
 -- In JS values have a type but in other static languages variable has a typ which means that we are telling that a particular variable can hold only some particular type.
 
Implicit Coercion:

a =2;
a= a + "";
console.log(a)
Here a is implicitly converted to string. This is implicit coercion.

** Code comments --> For developers understanding.

Comments should never say what. It should only say Why or How...

Variables and Blocks:
var, let, const, function -- Ways to declare varables

Block is a collection of statements within parenthesis.

Blocks can be attached with if, while, for and also function statements.
Where ever the block is attached, it is executed in the context of that.

Conversion to bool values:

FALSY Values :
0, 
-0, 
NaN, 
"", 
false, 
null
undefined

Anything other than the above value is a true.

What is the result of this below??

var a = 0;
if(a)
{
	console.log('hi');
}
else{
	Console.log('bye');
	} 
// Answer is bye

LOOPS
*********
For loop :

1.	for(a=5; a < 10; a++)

	a=5 --> Initialization expression
	a<10 --> Conditional expression
	a++ --> Updation expression
	All the three in a for loop are optional.

-- A loop runs until something is false.

************
Function
*************

-- Function is kind of like a block and which can be called multiple times. Its not like a loop.
.toFixed() --> Method on a number type which returns a string.

-- passing a function and passing the result of a function call.
